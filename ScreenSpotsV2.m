% function newspots = ScreenSpots(img,spotcenters,boxdim,varargin)
%
% Interactive function that allows user to choose spots, from those found by 
% FindSpotsV3, that they don't want included in further analyses.
%
% Inputs are the image that spots were found in, a vector of (x,y)
% coordinates where the spot centers are, and boxdim that determines the
% size of the box to put around each spot.  The user should click in the box
% in order to deselect or re-select a spot.  Output is a vector of the kept
% spotcenters.
%
% Optional input is a string to put on the image, so you know what you're
% analyzing.
%
% This version uses an updated version of PutBoxesOnImage that allows figure
% data to be replaced without replotting the whole thing--makes it much faster!
