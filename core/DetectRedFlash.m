% function params = DetectRedFlash(AcceptorMaxes,Medians,params)
%
% Called by ScaleMovie if the DetectRedFlash parameter in TracesSetup is
% nonzero. Looks for flashes of high intensity in the acceptor channel
% which we use to mark injection points. 
%
% A movie can contain multiple red flashes. A red flash needs to meet the
% following criteria in order to be detected:
% (1) A significant spike in acceptor channel intensity
% (2) A concurrent spike in the median intensity over the whole frame
% (excludes random spikes from very brief, bright junk spots in the
% acceptor channel)
% (3) No concurrent spike in the donor channel
% (4) Spikes must last more than one frame
