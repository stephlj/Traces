% function composite = CalcCombinedImage(A,b,StartImg,EndImg,ShowResults)
%
% Given two images and the transformation matrix and vectors A, b that 
% define an affine map from StartImg to EndImg (see outputs of CalcChannelMapping), 
% calculate the transformed version of StartImg and return a
% composite of EndImg and the transformed image.
%
% This is called by smFRET so that you can find spots in a composite image
% from both channels, the idea being that medium-FRET spots will have
% decreased intensities in the two channels and may be missed by a
% spotfinding algorithm that only looks for spots in green and spots in red
% separately.
%
% Note: you could also modify this code to find tform using built-in Matlab
% functions:
%   Use fitgeotrans with pairs of matching points:
%   tform = fitgeotrans(matchRall',matchGall','Affine');
%   where matchRall, matchRall are, for example, the pairs of points found
%   in smFRET from bead images. Or, use the Matlab function
%   cpselect to generate points manually.
%
% Update 1/2014: fitgeotrans does a bit better than my handwritten code in
% CalcChannelMapping; it might be iterating to find optimal solutions or
% something like that.  Regardless, I now use fitgeotrans, but, for
% backwards compatibility, turn the output of fitgeotrans into A, b, and
% then re-form tform here.
