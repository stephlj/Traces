% These control where the two figures that show traces and a field of view
% show up on your monitor. Numbers are [top left corner x position, top left y,
% width, height].  Run figure('Position',Fig2Pos) to see where the figure
% will show up; adjust the Fig2Pos vector elements as necessary.  Note: Macs
% and PC's have a different (0,0) for the monitor I think.

%%%%%%%% Microscope-specific parameters: %%%%%%%%
splitx = 1; %This means red-green channels are left and right (not top and bottom)
Acceptor = 0; %This means the acceptor channel is the one on the left 
    %(or on the top if splitx is 0)
% Our acquisition procedure automatically saves other necessary variables
% like how many pixels on each side our images our, the frame rate, etc.
% But those could be coded in here and then smFRET rewritten to use values
% from smFRETsetup rather than from the acquisition file.
    
%%%%%%%% Analysis parameters: %%%%%%%%
FramesToAvg = 10; %How many frames to average over for spotfinding
BeadSize = 10; %Diameter of a circle that defines a bead (used for the channel
    %mapping procedure); beads whose centers are closer than BeadSize will 
    %not be included, and found beads will be circled by a circle of radius BeadSize.  
BeadNeighborhood = 9^2; %Our spot-finding algorithm looks for local maxima in 
    %"neighborhoods" (see FindSpotsV4 comments). This defines the size of a
    %neighborhood (area, in square pixels) for the beads.  Needs to be a perfect
    %square, and best if sqrt(BeadNeighborhood) is odd.  Should be a little 
    %bigger than we expect beads to be.
DNASize = 10; %Same as BeadSize but for DNA: diameter of expected spots.  Note that
    %the code that actually calculates the intensity of a DNA spot is
    %currently hard-coded to integrate over a circle of diameter 5 pixels;
    %DNASize only determines how close two spots can be and still be
    %included in the analysis.
DNANeighborhood = 9^2;%Same as BeadNeighborhood but for DNA.
NormImg = 0; %If this is 1, UserSpotSelection will normalize every frame in a movie
    %such that the brightest pixel in that frame is 1, and the darkest is
    %0.  Not sure yet if that's the right thing to do or not.
SmoothIntensities = 3; %If this is zero (or negative), don't do any smoothing 
    %of the acceptor and donor intensities; if greater than zero, moving
    %average smoothing filter of width specified by this variable.  Must be
    %an integer.
SmoothFRET = 10; %Same as SmoothIntensities but for the FRET signal.  At some
    %point should implement a Gauss filter instead
